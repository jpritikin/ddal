This is a parody site to make fun of the folly of the war against
drugs. The modern drug was was started by [Harry
Anslinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_J._Anslinger) in the
1930s.  This is the same *idealistic* man who eventually cooperated to
[supply narcotics for Senator Joe
McCarthy](http://druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1970/drugswashdc.htm),
in effect becoming the nation's most hypocritical drug dealer. This
site is dedicated to him.

In an effort to avoid taking credit or blame for this parody site,
contributions are welcome.
